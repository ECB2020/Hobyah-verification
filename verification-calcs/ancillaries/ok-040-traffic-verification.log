  Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
  March 2024
  A file that verifies the calculation of stationary road traffic in a
  three tunnels.  In all tunnels, the majority of the losses are in
  traffic drag, not inlet/outlet losses or tunnel friction.
  The three tunnels have the same airflow but caused in different ways:
   * in the first tunnel, the back portal and forward portals are open
     to atmosphere with fixed pressures.
   * in the second tunnel, the back portal has a fixed velocity (set
     from the results of the first tunnel).
   * in the third tunnel, the forward portal has a fixed velocity (set
     from the results of the first tunnel).
  
  Portals with fixed pressure and fixed velocity are solved in different
  routines, so we need test files to check that their calculations don't
  differ.
  
  In this case the velocity being set at the back end of tunnel "second"
  in this file is 8.739696 m/s, the velocity being set at the forward
  end of tunnel "third" is 8.742097 m/s.
  
  These two velocities are taken from the velocities at the back end and
  forward end of tunnel "first" respectively (from an initial run).
  
  The way to verify that they have the same calculation is to look at
  the pressure profiles of the three tunnels.  If the traffic drag
  calculation in the fixed velocity boundary condition is calculated
  differently to the traffic drag in the pressure boundary condition,
  the pressure profiles will differ.
  
  Outcome:
  
  The velocities are the back ends and forward ends of the tunnels
  are as follows (air velocity in the variable named 'v_bin'):
  
      Tunnel      Back end        Forward end
       name     velocity (m/s)   velocity (m/s)
      ------    --------------   --------------
      first        8.739636         8.742097      (both ends fixed pressures)
      second       8.739636         8.742097      (back end fixed velocity)
      third        8.739636         8.742097      (fwd end fixed velocity)
  
  The pressures are the back ends and forward ends of the tunnels
  are as follows (gauge total pressure in the variable named
  'p_tot_bin'):
  
      Tunnel      Back end        Forward end
       name     pressure (Pa)    pressure (Pa)
      ------    -------------    -------------
      first       19.992597        -20.007410
      second      19.992598        -20.007410
      third       19.992598        -20.007413
  
  These pressures are equal down to the fifth decimal place, so we can
  that the traffic drag calculations at fixed velocity portals are the
  same as the traffic drag calculations at fixed pressure portals.
