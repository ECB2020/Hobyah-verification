# verification-calcs
The files in this folder verify specific calculations.  The explanations
of their verification is in the document "verification+validation.pdf",
read that document for the full story.

A summary of the aspects covered are:
 * The quadratics spreadsheet (incompressible flow in a tunnel of constant area with traffic and jet fans).
 * The calculation of annulus volume flow and annulus velocity in SESconv.py.
 * The calculation of warm volume flow and warm air velocity downwind of fires in SESconv.py.
 * The calculation of transient airflows in Hobyah.py.
 * The calculation of pressure losses in Hobyah.py.
 * The calculation of flow splits at junctions with between two and six tunnels attached in Hobyah.py.
